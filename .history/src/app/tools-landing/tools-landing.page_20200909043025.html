    <p style="padding: 20px; text-align: center;">The V believes in continuous progress,
      and this can only be attained
      if opportunities for advancement are
      provided for our V Ambassadors. As shown
      in the diagram below, an Independent
      Representative can attain V Elite Leader
      status once he or she has completed the V
      Advancement Programs successfully. Once
      they gain membership in
      V Elite Leadersâ€™ pool, they are now eligible
      to be nominated into the
      V Council.</p>

    <p style="padding: 20px; text-align: center;">
      From this point forward, any upward
      movement will be dependent on
      nomination and performance evaluation.
      Each level up requires a much tougher and
      stringent evaluation process, and also
      means that more
      responsibility is being undertaken by a V
      Ambassador. Benefits and
      privileges of each level of V
      Ambassadorship will be discussed in detail
      in the following chapters.
